# 📘 Leetcode-DSA-Tracker

Welcome to my personal repository where I upload my solutions to LeetCode problems. This repo serves as a comprehensive tracker of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice.

---

## 🚀 Purpose of This Repository

- 📌 To **track my daily DSA practice**.
- 🧠 To improve my **problem-solving and analytical skills** using popular DSA questions.
- 📚 To maintain a central place where I can review and reflect on past solutions.
- 💼 To showcase consistent effort and progress.

## 📂 File Structure

You may find files named like:

- `TwoSum.java`
- `LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters.java`
- `MergeSortedArray.java`
- `ValidParentheses.java`

Each file corresponds to one LeetCode problem.
